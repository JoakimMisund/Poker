# Poker
Simple poker server that allows users to play against up to 7 computer players. The user do not have to install a client to make us of the server. I have followed the poker scene for a couple of years, and I love the game. I was on the lookout for a small project and wanted to learn some more c++, so I thought this would be a good project.

When I write this, there is 1 year since I stopped working on the project. Looking back, I should have planned more. The code is messy, and there are many bugs.

## Running
clone <br/>

Server: <br/>
cd Poker <br/>
make <br/>
./bin/runner 5000 <br/> <br/>

client: <br/>
nc localhost 5000 <br/>
